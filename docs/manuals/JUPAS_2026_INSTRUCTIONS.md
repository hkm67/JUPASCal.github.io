# JUPAS Cal 2026 — Project Instructions

## Overview
An unofficial JUPAS score calculator for HK university applicants. Users input their DSE subject grades; the tool calculates estimated scores per programme based on each university's published weighting formula, then compares against historical admission scores.

## Data Sources (Per School)

Each school publishes data differently. Common formats: PDF, HTML table, or downloadable Excel.

- **HKU** — Publishes scoring formula + expected scores PDF; also has web page
- **CUHK** — PDF with admission scores and weightings per programme
- **HKUST** — PDF with admission scores
- **PolyU** — Subject weighting PDFs per programme (bulk download possible via script)
- **CityU** — Combined PDF: score formula + admission scores
- **HKBU** — Subject weight table PDF; detailed score page online
- **LingU** — Weighting PDF + admission scores PDF
- **EdUHK** — Combined weighting & entrance requirements PDF + admission scores PDF
- **HKMU** — Admission scores PDF
- **SSSDP** — Varies per institution in the list

## Score Calculation Methods

Different schools / programmes use different formulas. Common patterns:

- **Best 5** — Top 5 subject scores (with or without Chinese/English/Maths required)
- **3 Cores + 2 Electives** — Compulsory Chinese, English, Maths + best 2 electives
- **3 Cores + 2 Electives (Science required)** — As above but one elective must be a science subject
- **Weighted score** — Each subject multiplied by a programme-specific weighting factor
- **Bonus points** — Some schools add bonus for certain subjects or grades

## Automation Status (2026 cycle — complete)

All per-school scrapers are implemented and have been run. See `CLAUDE.md` for the script reference table.

- JUPAS overview: `scripts/extraction/2026_scrap.py` → `data/raw/2026 JUPAS Program Overview.xlsx`
- Per-school JSON outputs: `Reference(2026)/{School}/{School}_2026_Data.json`
- Unified master: `data/processed/JUPAS_2026_Unified_Data.json` (432 programmes)

---

## Web Application

The Excel-based calculator has been replaced with a static web app:
- `index.html` + `js/calculator.js` + `js/ui.js` + `css/style.css`
- Pure vanilla JS, hosted on GitHub Pages, no backend
- See `docs/manuals/WEBAPP_PLAN.md` for architecture details
